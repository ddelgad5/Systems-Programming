I keep the security system for my secret recipe here. Open the Java program just like you would open any other file using a terminal. CAREFULLY read the instructions for running the program at the top of the file.

You will need to move this program to use it... I remember making a note to myself about this in the `/entrees` directory.

## Running Java Programs

When running Java programs in a terminal, we must first compile them, like so:

```
$ javac FILENAME.java
```

If there are no error messages when compiling, a file named `FILENAME.class` will be created. You can check for it using `ls`. This means you can run the program (no file extension):

```
$ java FILENAME
```

You don't need to concern yourself with the code of the program, it won't help you decipher the recipe unless you have learned the answers to my security questions.

Each of my security questions protects a different part of the file, if you only get some of the answers, you will only get some of the file.
