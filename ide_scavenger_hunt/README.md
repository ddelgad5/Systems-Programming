# Chef Gordon RAMSay's Private Files

Welcome, Apprentice Chef. As you know, I have retired from the culinary arts. I leave you my private files. Hidden among them is my greatest recipe, stored safely under digital lock and key in the `/secrets` directory.

If you can access my secret recipe, it is yours for the taking.

## Using the Terminal

To find it, you will have to learn to navigate these files using the terminal. If you see a line like this, it is an instruction that you can type into your terminal:

```
$ echo "Yes, Chef!"
```

Don't type the `$`, that just indicates that the rest of the line can be run in your terminal. Now try it.

...

I organize all my files into directories (you call them folders). You currently have access to the top-level directory of my files. To list all of the files and folders in this directory, run this command:

```
$ ls
```

You can use `ls` to list the contents of any folder.

If you intend to find my secret recipe, you'd better start searching. To change the directory you are in, run:

```
$ cd FOLDERNAME
```

To go "up" one folder level, run:

```
$ cd ..
```

And finally, if you find a file of interest (like another README.md file), you can view it with:

```
$ open FILENAME
```

Good luck,
Chef Gordon RAMsay
