## Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks

I think of shell commands as recipes, where data sources are the ingredients. Combine them in the right order and you can create wonders.

A chef's intuition is valuable, but to learn, one must experiment! I approach coding the same way. Just yesterday I learned a new command that I may find useful soon:

```
$ cat FILE_1 FILE_2 FILE_3 > OUTPUT_FILE
```

The `cat` command (among other things) concatenates files. I think if I ever wanted to send someone a digest of my recipes, I could just concatenate the ones I want into one file and send it over!

I read all about it on the website of [the Linux Information Project](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html). Hopefully that's a reputable resource. Even for an experienced shell chef like me, there's no shame in using the internet to find new, useful approaches.

I concatenated some of my favorite insults into a file for safe keeping. However, I have no plans to do the same with my academy diploma. I hated the culinary academy. They insulted me constantly. When I got my diploma, I ripped it into four shreds.
